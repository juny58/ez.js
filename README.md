# ezee.js
ezee.js is a simple lightweight yet powerful framework in making that will include native browser routing and in-built independent state management system. I always felt there is a better way of it. I am doing a continuous development. Any contribution would be appreciated.

## Roadmap
1. Create file system which generates an html, a js and a css file scoped to that html only and call them a component
2. Create bridge between them to handle data rendition
3. Create routing mechanism
4. Create state management system
