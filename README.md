# ez.js
ez.js is a simple lightweight yet powerful framework in making that will include native browser routing and in-built independent state management system. I always felt there is a better way of it. I am doing a continuous development. Any contribution would be appreciated.

## Roadmap
1. Make a cli to help create the components and projects
2. Create file system which generates an html, a js and a css file scoped to that html only and call them a component
3. Create bridge between them to handle data rendition
4. Create routing mechanism
5. Create state management system
